# Global Scripts

Custom scripts can be installed for all users (for easy distribution) by placing them in `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/boop-gtk/scripts`. If `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` is not set the default is `/etc/xdg`. Note however, unlike the users personal scripts folder, this folder is not watched and thus requires restarting the application to load new scripts.

If your looking for additional scripts see [Boop's additional scripts](https://github.com/IvanMathy/Boop/tree/main/Scripts).
